# mpv-settings
my settings for MPV (Windows/Mac/Linux Compatible)

might not be suitable for your pc, but if you have any recommendations, just tell me, 
or just make a pull request. If i like it, i put it in.

# Installation
Depending on your Operating System, you need to place the stuff inside the zip in a certain directory.
The root directory needs to look like this:

->mpv

-->input.conf

-->mpv.conf

--->shaders

--->script-opts

--->scripts

you need to rename the proper config you want to use to mpv.conf.

example: mpv-windows.conf -> mpv.conf
